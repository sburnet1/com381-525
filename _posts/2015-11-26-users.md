There will be 2 types* of Walkr users —
   
Donor: Someone who gives money — donations would be accepted at any amount, but the focus would be on constant, progressive donations to people who start walking and keep up the habit. Even at small rates per mile (1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, etc) the donations will add up quickly. Donors can sign up to fund their friends and/or use GPS to locate top walkers in their city/town/area/community/zip code (or a 5/10/15 mile radius, etc) and choose to fund them in addition to other walkers they currently fund.

Walker (or Mover?): Someone who walks (or rolls under their own power) to earn money, and feel better about themselves and their community.

*An individual can be both a walker and a donor if they choose.
