Principles Involved:

Motivational — What gets people interested & keeps them going?
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs — Physiological, Love (for health, self, fitness, community), Self-Esteem, Self-Actualization.
80/20 Rule — A small number of walkers/donors, or a large number of donations of small amounts each can have a big effect.

In-App — How to make Donors & Walkers in-app experiences better?
Accessibility — Needs to be usable by all movers & donors regardless of ability.
Personas — What types of people will use this app?
Similarity — Use of Gmaps interface and similar iconography to other walking/running apps (Endomodo, Gmaps Pedometer, Map My Walk).
