Goal: An application/foundation to encourage everyday people to get out and move around — users would be “walkers” and/or “donors”. The distance that walkers walk (or roll, self-propelled) is recorded (via GPS?) and donors would donate money to the foundation based on the number of miles walked (at a rate per mile of their choosing?).

Main theme: Promoting health & charitable giving — donations will fund charitable giving/repair of movement devices for the disabled, those who are not able to get out and move themselves.

Context: A majority of people walk or move around every day, some more than others. Why not harness that movement for greater good?
