Goal: An application/foundation to encourage everyday people to get out and move around — users would
be “walkers” and/or “donors”. The distance that walkers walk (or roll, self-propelled) is recorded (via GPS?) 
and donors would donate money to the foundation based on the number of miles walked (at a rate per mile of their choosing?).

Main theme: Promoting health & charitable giving — donations will fund charitable giving/repair of movement
devices for the disabled, those who are not able to get out and move themselves.

Context: A majority of people walk or move around every day, some more than others. Why not harness 

Users: 2 types* —
    
    Donor: Someone who gives money — donations would be accepted at any amount, but the focus would
    be on constant, progressive donations to people who start walking and keep up the habit. Even at
    small rates per mile (1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, etc) the donations will add up quickly. Donors can 
    sign up to fund their friends and/or use GPS to locate top walkers in their city/town/area/community/zip code 
    (or a 5/10/15 mile radius, etc) and choose to fund them in addition to other walkers they currently fund.

    Walker (or Mover?): Someone who walks (or rolls under their own power) to earn money, and feel better about 
    themselves and their community.

    *An individual can be both a walker and a donor if they choose.
