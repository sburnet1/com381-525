Goal: An application/foundation to encourage everyday people to get out and move around — users would be “walkers” and/or “donors”. The distance that walkers walk (or roll, self-propelled) is recorded (via GPS?) and donors would donate money to the foundation based on the number of miles walked (at a rate per mile of their choosing?).

Main theme: Promoting health & charitable giving — donations will fund charitable giving/repair of movement devices for the disabled, those who are not able to get out and move themselves.

Context: A majority of people walk or move around every day, some more than others. Why not harness 

Users: 2 types* —
    
    Donor: Someone who gives money — donations would be accepted at any amount, but the focus would be on constant, progressive donations to people who start walking and keep up the habit. Even at small rates per mile (1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, etc) the donations will add up quickly. Donors can sign up to fund their friends and/or use GPS to locate top walkers in their city/town/area/community/zip code (or a 5/10/15 mile radius, etc) and choose to fund them in addition to other walkers they currently fund.

    Walker (or Mover?): Someone who walks (or rolls under their own power) to earn money, and feel better about themselves and their community.

    *An individual can be both a walker and a donor if they choose.

Principles Involved: 

    Motivational — What gets people interested & keeps them going?
    Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs — Physiological, Love (for health, self, fitness, community), Self-Esteem, Self-Actualization.
    80/20 Rule — A small number of walkers/donors, or a large number of donations of small amounts each can have a big effect.
    
    In-App — How to make Donors & Walkers in-app experiences better?
    Accessibility — Needs to be usable by all movers & donors regardless of ability.
    Personas — What types of people will use this app? 
    Similarity — Use of Gmaps interface and similar iconography to other walking/running apps (Endomodo, Gmaps Pedometer, Map My Walk).

Interface:

    The attached screen shot shows the opening screen of the app. Walkers would be able to see how far they’ve walked each day via a Gmaps record and who is currently donating on their behalf. Donors would be able to view lists of walkers and the distances they’ve walked (but not their routes) based on an area/community of their choosing and assign donations to those they favor, as well as see who they’re already donating to and what amount(s).
